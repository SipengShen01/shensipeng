I am a postgraduate student at School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University. My current research is focusing on Adversarial Examples in deeplearning models, supervised by Prof. Dengpan Ye. During my Master's studies, I explored the use of adversarial examples to address privacy issues in deep learning models. In the future, I aim to delve deeper into the safety and controllable generation of multimodal large models.
